# Vibe-proof: security hardening for full-stack apps

**Purpose**: Audit and fix security vulnerabilities in vibe-coded full-stack applications through parallel multi-layer analysis and guided remediation, fixing in severity order.

## Origin

Refined across two real hardening sessions: a React + Express + Stripe e-commerce platform deployed to Vercel, then a Next.js + Supabase + CRM medical platform. Between both sessions, 85+ issues were found, including SQL injection, hardcoded backdoor passwords, secrets in URL params, `.env` files in git, and missing security headers.

## When to use

- After vibe-coding an MVP with API routes, databases, or payment integrations
- Before a first real deployment or first real customer
- When you suspect "it works, but is it safe?"
- Any Express / React / Next.js / Nuxt app with a backend

## The seven security checks

### 1. Injection vectors

- [ ] No user input in SQL/query strings without parameterization
- [ ] Sort columns and filter fields use allowlist validation
- [ ] No `eval()`, `new Function()`, or template-literal injection
- [ ] URL params parsed with bounds checking (`parseInt` with min/max)
- [ ] Enum fields (gender, status, role) validated against `const` allowlists

### 2. PII and secret exposure

- [ ] No hardcoded addresses, phone numbers, or names in source
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or backdoor auth strings
- [ ] API tokens in headers (`Authorization`), never in URL params
- [ ] Admin endpoint secrets use `Authorization: Bearer`, not query params
- [ ] No `.env` files tracked in git (`git ls-files | grep -i env`)
- [ ] No secrets in client-side code or in `VITE_*` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars that should not be public
- [ ] `.env.example` documents all required variables (sync secrets, CRM keys, service keys)
- [ ] No `localhost` URLs in production allowlists (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, CSP, etc.)

### 3. Missing security headers

- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (or `SAMEORIGIN` if iframes are needed)
- [ ] `X-XSS-Protection: 0` (modern best practice; disables the buggy browser filter)
- [ ] `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- [ ] `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off` (privacy; prevents browser DNS leaks)
- [ ] Body size limits on `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` (Express)
- [ ] CSP `img-src` restricted to specific CDN domains, not an `https:` wildcard
- [ ] CSP `script-src` without `unsafe-eval` (remove if WebGL/shaders were deleted)

### 4. Error leakage

- [ ] Production error responses do not expose stack traces
- [ ] 500 errors return a generic message, not `error.message`
- [ ] No `console.log` of sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII)
- [ ] A structured logger is used instead of `console.*` in production code
- [ ] Catch blocks return masked errors: `"Internal server error"`, not `err.message`

### 5. Input validation gaps

- [ ] All POST/PUT endpoints validate the body with Zod or equivalent
- [ ] Query params have type coercion and bounds (`limit`, `offset`, `id`)
- [ ] Integer params checked against `MAX_INT` (2147483647)
- [ ] Enum params validated against `const ALLOWED_X = [...] as const` allowlists
- [ ] File uploads check size AND validate magic bytes, not just the MIME header
- [ ] File extensions derived from validated MIME type, not the user-supplied filename
- [ ] Token/secret params validated for format (min length, charset) before DB lookup
- [ ] Text inputs sanitized (strip HTML tags, dangerous chars) before storage

### 6. Dead code and attack surface

- [ ] Unused routes/endpoints removed
- [ ] Unused components deleted, not commented out
- [ ] Disabled features removed entirely, not just `if (false)`
- [ ] Test/debug endpoints not present in production
- [ ] Unused npm packages removed
- [ ] No GET handler aliasing POST on write endpoints (`export { POST as GET }`)
- [ ] No conflicting static + dynamic files (e.g. `robots.txt` + `robots.ts`)
- [ ] Unused client utility functions removed (dead `createBrowserClient`, etc.)
- [ ] Video embeds use privacy-enhanced mode (`youtube-nocookie.com`)

### 7. Credential hygiene

- [ ] Session secrets are 32+ characters
- [ ] Cookies set `httpOnly`, `secure` (production), `sameSite: 'lax'`
- [ ] Trust proxy configured when behind a reverse proxy (Vercel, nginx)
- [ ] Webhook endpoints verify signatures (Stripe, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth, checkout, newsletter, AND admin/sync endpoints
- [ ] Rate-limiting strategy fits the platform (in-memory is defense-in-depth on serverless; use Upstash/KV for persistent limiting)

## Execution process

### Phase 1: parallel audit (read-only)

Launch three scans in parallel to cover different layers simultaneously. Each can run as a dedicated audit agent if your setup has them (for example a frontend-security audit agent, a backend/API-security audit agent, and a config/credential audit agent), or as three focused passes by a single agent. The prompts below define what each pass looks for.

**Frontend audit:**

```text
Audit the frontend code for security issues:
- XSS vectors (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, unescaped user input)
- Sensitive data in client-side code
- Tracking pixels with undefined variables
- console.log statements leaking data
- Dead/unused components
- API keys or tokens in VITE_*/NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars that should not be public
- Video embeds not using privacy-enhanced mode
- sessionStorage/localStorage holding PII unnecessarily
Report each issue with file:line, severity, and a fix suggestion.
```

**Backend / API audit:**

```text
Audit the backend code for security issues:
- SQL injection (user input in query strings, unvalidated sort/filter)
- Missing input validation on POST/PUT endpoints
- Hardcoded PII (addresses, phone numbers, names)
- Hardcoded passwords or backdoor auth strings
- API tokens or secrets in URL params instead of the Authorization header
- GET handlers that alias POST on write endpoints
- console.log/error statements (should use a structured logger)
- Error handlers leaking internal details (returning err.message to the client)
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (including admin/sync)
- Missing enum/allowlist validation on fields like gender, status, role
- File extension derived from user filename instead of validated MIME type
- Duplicate utility code that should be extracted to shared modules
Report each issue with file:line, severity, and a fix suggestion.
```

**Config and credential audit:**

```text
Audit configuration and credentials:
- .env files tracked in git (git ls-files | grep -i env)
- .env.example missing required variables
- Security headers present/missing (check next.config headers or Express middleware)
- X-XSS-Protection should be "0" (not "1; mode=block")
- HSTS header with adequate max-age (63072000+) and preload
- CSP img-src using a wildcard https: instead of specific domains
- CSP script-src with unnecessary unsafe-eval
- localhost URLs in production allowlists (ALLOWED_ORIGINS, CSP connect-src)
- Body size limits configured (Express)
- Session configuration (secret length, cookie flags)
- Trust proxy setting
- Conflicting static + dynamic files (robots.txt vs robots.ts)
- Dead code files (unused components, disabled features)
- Unused npm dependencies (especially heavy ones like shader libs)
Report each issue with file:line, severity, and a fix suggestion.
```

### Phase 2: synthesize and prioritize

Combine all findings into one prioritized list:

| Priority | Category | Fix order |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | Backdoor passwords, injection, credential leaks, secrets in URLs | Fix first |
| HIGH | PII exposure, missing validation, error leakage, missing HSTS, GET-as-POST | Fix second |
| MEDIUM | Missing rate limits, enum validation, dead code, CSP tightening | Fix third |
| LOW | Unused packages, `console.log`, config optimization | Fix last |

**Deduplication**: parallel passes find overlapping issues. Merge duplicates and keep the most detailed description.

### Phase 3: systematic fix execution

Fix in priority order. After each fix category, run `npm run build` (or the project equivalent) and verify no regressions.

**Common fix patterns:**

#### Backdoor password removal

```typescript
// BEFORE: hardcoded backdoor (CRITICAL)
const password = searchParams.get("password");
if (password !== "myapp2024") return unauthorized();

// AFTER: environment variable via Authorization header
const authHeader = request.headers.get("authorization");
const secret = authHeader?.replace(/^Bearer\s+/i, "");
if (!process.env.SYNC_SECRET || !secret || secret !== process.env.SYNC_SECRET) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

#### Enum allowlist validation

```typescript
// Define allowlists as const arrays
const ALLOWED_GENDERS = ["male", "female", "other"] as const;
const ALLOWED_LANGUAGES = ["es", "en"] as const;

// Validate before using
if (!ALLOWED_GENDERS.includes(data.gender)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid gender value" }, { status: 400 });
}
```

#### MIME-based file extension

```typescript
// BEFORE: trust the user filename (attackable)
const ext = file.name.split('.').pop();

// AFTER: derive from validated MIME type
const MIME_TO_EXT: Record<string, string> = {
  "application/pdf": "pdf",
  "image/jpeg": "jpg",
  "image/png": "png",
  "image/webp": "webp",
};
const ext = MIME_TO_EXT[file.type] || "bin";
```

#### DRY: extract shared service clients

```typescript
// BEFORE: createClient() duplicated across 3+ route files

// AFTER: shared module (e.g. src/lib/service.ts)
import { createClient, SupabaseClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

export function createServiceClient(): SupabaseClient | null {
  const url = process.env.SERVICE_SUPABASE_URL;
  const key = process.env.SERVICE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY;
  if (!url || !key) return null;
  return createClient(url, key);
}
```

#### SQL injection (allowlist pattern)

```typescript
const ALLOWED_SORT_COLUMNS: Record<string, string> = {
  'created': 'created_at',
  'rating': 'average_rating',
  'name': 'name',
  'price': 'price::numeric',
};

if (filters?.sortBy && ALLOWED_SORT_COLUMNS[filters.sortBy]) {
  const sortColumn = ALLOWED_SORT_COLUMNS[filters.sortBy];
  query += ` ORDER BY ${sortColumn}`;
}
```

#### API token in header (not URL)

```typescript
// BEFORE: token in URL (visible in logs, browser history)
const url = `${API_URL}?access_token=${TOKEN}`;

// AFTER: token in Authorization header
fetch(API_URL, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${TOKEN}` }
});
```

#### Security headers, Next.js (next.config.ts)

```typescript
// In the next.config.ts headers() array:
{ key: "X-Content-Type-Options", value: "nosniff" },
{ key: "X-Frame-Options", value: "DENY" },
{ key: "X-XSS-Protection", value: "0" },  // modern: disable the buggy filter
{ key: "Referrer-Policy", value: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
{ key: "Strict-Transport-Security", value: "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" },
{ key: "X-DNS-Prefetch-Control", value: "off" },
```

#### Security headers, Express (middleware)

```typescript
app.use((_req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '0');
  res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload');
  next();
});
```

#### Error response masking

```typescript
// Express
app.use((err, _req, res, _next) => {
  const status = err.status || 500;
  res.status(status).json({
    error: status >= 500 ? 'Internal Server Error' : err.message
  });
});

// Next.js route handler
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Route error:", err);  // log internally
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Internal server error" },  // mask externally
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

#### Remove GET-as-POST alias

```typescript
// BEFORE: exposes a write endpoint to GET requests (CSRF, caching, logging)
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return POST(request);
}

// AFTER: delete the GET export entirely. Only export POST.
```

### Phase 4: credential remediation

If `.env` files were tracked in git:

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo ".env.production" >> .gitignore

# Remove from tracking (keeps the local file)
git rm --cached .env.production

# Then rotate ALL exposed credentials
```

**Credentials that MUST be rotated if exposed:**

- Database passwords / Supabase service role keys
- API keys (Stripe, Shippo, Resend, CRM, etc.)
- Session/sync secrets
- Webhook signing secrets

### Phase 5: environment variable provisioning

If deploying to Vercel, set env vars via the API:

```bash
# Get the project id
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects?teamId=$TEAM_ID" | \
  jq '.projects[] | select(.name == "PROJECT_NAME") | .id'

# Set an env var (returns ENV_CONFLICT if it already exists)
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/$PROJECT_ID/env?teamId=$TEAM_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "VAR_NAME", "value": "VAR_VALUE", "type": "encrypted", "target": ["production", "preview"]}'
```

### Phase 6: verify and deploy

```bash
# Build verification
npm run build

# Commit (conventional commit format)
git commit -m "fix(security): harden platform [summary of fixes]"

# Push and deploy
git push origin main
```

### Phase 7: post-deploy connection verification

After deploy, verify all external services are reachable from production:

1. Test each service endpoint with a minimal query (Supabase: `select count`, CRM API: `GET /contacts?limit=1`).
2. Check for common failures:
   - `ENOTFOUND` / `NXDOMAIN` means a Supabase free-tier project is paused (unpause in the dashboard).
   - `401 Unauthorized` means an API key mismatch between `.env.local` and the deploy env vars.
   - A `schema cache` error means Supabase just restored; wait 1-2 minutes.
3. Clean up any test records created during verification (check all synced downstream services).

## Success criteria

- [ ] Build passes with zero warnings
- [ ] No user input reaches SQL without parameterization or allowlist
- [ ] No PII or hardcoded passwords in source code
- [ ] No API tokens or secrets in URLs
- [ ] No `.env` files tracked in git
- [ ] Security headers present on all responses (HSTS, DENY, nosniff)
- [ ] Error responses do not leak internals
- [ ] All POST/PUT endpoints validate input (including enum allowlists)
- [ ] File extensions derived from MIME type, not filename
- [ ] Dead code deleted, not commented
- [ ] No GET aliases for POST endpoints
- [ ] Exposed credentials rotated
- [ ] All external service connections verified post-deploy

## Lessons learned

1. **Parallel audit passes save time.** Three passes scanning different layers at once catch issues that sequential review misses.

2. **Sort columns are the number-one SQL injection vector in vibe-coded apps.** Everyone parameterizes WHERE clauses and forgets ORDER BY.

3. **`.env` files in git are common.** Always check `git ls-files | grep -i env` as the very first step.

4. **Hardcoded "temporary" passwords become permanent backdoors.** Search for string comparisons against literals in auth logic: `password !== "something"`, `secret === "hardcoded"`.

5. **GET aliasing POST is a silent CSRF vector.** `export { POST as GET }` or `GET(req) { return POST(req) }` exposes write endpoints to CSRF, browser prefetch, and CDN caching.

6. **`X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` is outdated.** The modern recommendation is `0`; the browser filter itself has been exploited. CSP is the real protection.

7. **Enum validation is easy to forget.** Gender, status, role, language: any field with a finite set of values needs a `const` allowlist, not just type checking.

8. **File extension from filename is attackable.** A file named `malware.pdf.exe` with an `application/pdf` MIME type should get `.pdf` from the MIME type, not `.exe` from the name.

9. **Duplicate service client code means duplicate security gaps.** Extract shared modules (`lib/service.ts`, `lib/crm.ts`) so auth logic is fixed in one place.

10. **The Vercel API for env vars is faster than the dashboard.** One curl loop sets ten variables in seconds.

11. **Supabase free tier pauses after inactivity.** The DNS record disappears (NXDOMAIN). After unpause, the schema cache takes 1-2 minutes to warm. Production may work before local because of separate connection pools.

12. **Always test connections after deploy.** A passing build does not prove services are reachable. Test each external service with a minimal query post-deploy.

13. **`localhost` in production origin allowlists is a real finding.** It is easy to leave `http://localhost:3000` in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` during development.
